Course Wiki

## **DAY 1**  [Shell and Terminal (optional/preliminary)](https://github.com/eml11/topics-python-in-research/blob/master/shell.org)
  If you can do the [following exercises](https://github.com/eml11/topics-python-in-research/wiki/Shell-Requirements) then you do not need to come to this part of the course

  Exercises  
  * Remove LaTeX compilation by-products (i.e. files ending in _.log_
    and _.aux_) in a directory hierarchy which is 10 levels deep (hint:
    _find_).
  * List all executable files in the current directory, including "hidden" ones.
  * List of directories in the current directory.
  * Write a shell script which outputs "_filename_ is older" if
    _filename_ is older than your _~/.bashrc_ and "_filename_ is newer"
    it it is not older.

  * c compilation example [here](https://github.com/eml11/topics-python-in-research/tree/master/exmple_compilation).  

## **DAY 2**  [Python Language (optional/preliminary)](https://github.com/eml11/topics-python-in-research/blob/master/python.org)
  If you can do the [following exercises](https://github.com/eml11/topics-python-in-research/wiki/Python-Requirements) then you do not need to come to this part of the course

  Exercises  
  * Create a family (phylogenic) tree of a chosen animal using class inheritance  
  * Write a program which computes the 100 first Fibonacci numbers and prints them out as a comma and space separated list, splitting the output into lines of as close as possible but no more than 80 characters long. Make sure your Fibonacci-generator is reusable and has unit tests.  
  * Program Conway's Game of Life.

## **DAY 3**  
  **Morning** [I/O](https://github.com/eml11/topics-python-in-research/blob/master/io.org)  
  Exercises  
  * Save and load a 100x100x100 numpy array: 
    1. On your own
    2. numpy functions
    3. h5py  
 
  **Afternoon** [Data Visualisation](https://github.com/eml11/topics-python-in-research/blob/master/visualisation.org)  
  Exercises  
  * Save a datacube to a HDF5 file which can be read in by Paraview
  * Animate Conway's Game of Life   

## **DAY 4**  
  **Morning** [Principal Component Analysis, Fast Fourier Transforms, Convolution](https://github.com/eml11/topics-python-in-research/blob/master/mcmc_and_stats.pdf)  
  Exercises  
  * Look at Scipy.Stats and write a hypothesis test if this is relevant to your project  
  * Use data_generator.py in [sample-answers](https://github.com/eml11/topics-python-in-research/tree/master/sample-answers) to generate sample data and preform Principal Component Analysis on this.
  * Use convolution with a window function to improve the algorithm to calculate Conway's Game of Life.

  **Afternoon** [Markov Chains, Monti-Carlo](https://github.com/eml11/topics-python-in-research/blob/master/mcmc_and_stats.pdf)  
  Also
  * Additional Notes [mcmc.pdf](https://github.com/eml11/topics-python-in-research/blob/master/mcmc.pdf)/[mcmc.ipynb](https://github.com/eml11/topics-python-in-research/blob/master/mcmc.ipynb)

  Exercises  
  * Write hypothesis test using scipy.stats
  * Preform PCA on dataset generated by [data_generator.py](https://github.com/eml11/topics-python-in-research/blob/master/sample-answers/data_generator.py). This must be run from the sample answers directory
  * Sample a square or finite domain uniformly    

## **DAY 5**
  **Morning** [Optimisation](https://github.com/eml11/topics-python-in-research/blob/master/optimisation.pdf)  
  Exercises  
  * Implement the steepest decent algorithm
  * Use to find Minimum of Rosenbrock Function
 
  **Afternoon** [Integration, ODEs, PDEs](https://github.com/eml11/topics-python-in-research/blob/master/ode_pde.ipynb)  
  Also
  * pdf of above [Integration, ODEs, PDEs](https://github.com/eml11/topics-python-in-research/blob/master/ode_pde.pdf)

  Exercises  
  * ODE Initial Value Problem, solve x''(t) = - k \sin x(t)
  * ODE Boundary Value Problem, solve y''(x) = y'(x) + sin(x) exp(x), y(-pi) = 0, y(pi) = 1
  * ODE Boundary Value Problem, as above but with y(-pi) = 1, y'(pi) = 0 
  * PDE Heat Equation with Source. solve Laplacian u(x, y) = exp(- 2 ((x - 0.5)^2 + (y - 0.5)^2)), u(x, 0) = 1, u(0, y) = 1 - y, u(x, 1) = u(1, y) = 0
  * PDE Heat Equation and Flow. Same Boundaries as above but with Laplacian u(x, y) = v(x, y) . grad u(x, y) + exp(- 2 ((x - 0.5)^2 + (y - 0.5)^2)), for some choice of v(x, y)
